BASIC IDEA : EXPERIENCE THE ULTIMATE IN PERSONALIZATION WITH OUR BRAND NEW 3D CUSTOMISATION TOOL.
             TAKE YOUR CREATIVITY TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND BRING YOUR UNIQUE STYLE TO LIFE WITH OUR ONE-OF-A-KIND SHIRT THAT REFLECTS YOUR PERSONALITY.
             SO WHY SETTLE FOR A GENERIC SHIRT WHEN YOU CAN DEFINE YOUR OWN STYLE? START CREATING TODAY WITH OUR 3D CUSTOMISATION TOOL,
             AND MAKE A STATEMENT THAT IS YOUR OWN.
            
## REAL LIFE PROBLEM WE FACED : 
FOR DESIGNING T-SHIRTS/MERCHANDICE/SWEATSHIRT OR ANY OTHER KIND OF CUSTOMISATION YOU NEED ON CLOTHING, THE CERTAIN SOURCES WHICH 
WE USE TODAY GENERALLY HAVE CREDIT SYSTEM OR  PREMIUM ACCOUNT SYSTEM. AND ALSO THEY ARE A BIT DIFFICULT TO FIND THE CORRECT ELEMENTS ACCORDING TO YOUR WISH.
                             
                             
## HOW WE TRIED TO SOLVE IT :  
SO WE CREATED AN OPEN SOURCE WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN USE THE HELP OF OUR AI CHAT BOT FOR YOUR CUSTOMISATION,CHANGE COLOURS OF THE GARMENTS,
ADD MULTIPLE LOGOS AND CAN DOWNLOAD THE 2D MODEL OF THE MERCH.
                             
## WHAT WE STILL NEED TO ACHIEVE : 
* AND OUR FUTURE GOAL IS TO MAKE THIS SITE FUNCTIONAL TOWARDS MARKETING WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUY THE MERCH CUSTOMISED BY YOURSELF.
 * WE ALSO ARE WORKING ON OUR OWN AI TO PERSONALIZE THE FIT OF THE MERCH TO THE BODY BY ACTUALLY GETTING THE MEASUREMENTS OF YOUR BODY BY SCANNING IT.
